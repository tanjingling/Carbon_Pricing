### How Countries Price Carbon: A Policy Diffusion Approach

This repository contains the analysis presented in my Honours Thesis paper, "How Countries Price Carbon: A Policy Diffusion Approach". The thesis is submitted in partial fulfilment for the Bachelor of Social Science (Honours) Degree, to the Department of Political Science at the National University of Singapore. It is supervised by A/P Soo Yeon Kim.

This repository contains all material necessary to replicate the results of my paper. To replicate it, you will need R to execute the code. 

The following outlines how this repository is structured:

### 01_Data
This folder contains only csv data files that are used in this project. The data contains publicly available datasets from the World Bank, the Databse of Political Institutions 2020, and the French CEPII gravity database. Some interpolation and modifications are made, as described in the paper. 

### 02_Code
This folder contains only markdown files that document this project, plus accompanying knitted html files. One set of files document the main analysis conducted using the csv data files, including the plots and descriptive statistics made. Another set of files documents the supplementary analysis conducted with the inclusion of the EU ETS prices. 

### 03_Outputs
This folder contains the output files -- the key regression summary tables and plots used in the paper. 

The affordance of these replication files aims to further public knowledge and scrunity of carbon pricing policies in the world. I intend to supplement the findings of this paper through future extensions that explore other mechanisms of diffusion -- particularly how trade and perceived competition affects the interdependence of carbon pricing.
